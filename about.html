                          performing songs in Korean and Mandarin. After several
                          member changes, in December 2011, the group was
                          finally named as Exo, after the word "exoplanet". They
                          are divided into two sub-groups: Exo-K for South Korea
                          and Exo-M for China. The group's first television
                          appearance was on the annual SBS Gayo Daejeon show on

                          of the EP was number one on South Korea's Gaon Album

                          Unlike the Mama EP, for which Exo-K and Exo-M had
                          separate promotions, XOXO was promoted together,
                          mostly in South Korea. Exo recorded the lead single of
                          the album, "Wolf" together, but the other songs of the
                          album were recorded separately. A new version of the
                          album, titled Growl, was released on 5 August 2013,
                          with three additional songs. The new single titled
                          "Growl" was at number three on the Billboard K-Pop Hot
                          100 and at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. All
                          versions of XOXO collectively sold over one million
                          copies, making Exo the first South Korean artist to
                          achieve this milestone in 12 years. In December that
                          year, Exo released a second EP, Miracles in December,
                          as a winter special album that produced a single
                          titled the same as the album title. Following the
                          release, the group promoted the album through their
                          first reality show, Exo's Showtime, which premiered on
                          28 November 2013 on MBC's Every 1 cable channel.
                          Following their 2013 release, Exo won Song of the Year
                          at the Melon Music Awards for "Growl", Disc Daesang at
